Description
This project requires you to analyze 'Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes' data available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95.

While you can download the data directly from the URL above, for this class project we will use the data as of Aug 15, 2023 that has already been downloaded for you and is available in Jupyterhub at "shared/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes.pkl".  

You can read this file into a dataframe df using the command df = pd.read_pickle(r"shared/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes.pkl")

You should review the data dictionary for the data, also available on the above website.

You are required to perform exploratory data analysis using a Jupyter notebook with sufficient comments/markdown explanations so your analysis can be reviewed as a standalone document by a reader.

Assume a client has provided you this data and asked you for insights.  Explore the data using the EDA and visualization techniques we learned about in the class.  This work should be done in a Jupyter notebook.  Use markdown cells liberally to explain your work, because you can also share it on Github as a personal project.

Once you are satisfied with your review of the data, answer the questions below.  Even though your grade for this project will be determined by just the questions below, you should perform as comprehensive an analysis as you would like, imagining an external client to be the audience for your work.

(To help you get started, an example starter notebook is available at 'shared/NYC_Vehicle_Crash_Analysis.ipynb'.  You are welcome to use this file for inspiration and ideas, but your work should reflect your style and what you are comfortable presenting and defending in front of an external audience.)
